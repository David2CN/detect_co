# detect_co
## detect common objects in an image
This project was inspired and is derived from the ungraded lab in week 1 of the first course in the<br>
[Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops):Introduction to Machine Learning in Production.

Unlike the lab, which used the YOLOV3 model from the cvlib library, I used the [YOLOV5](https://pytorch.org/hub/ultralytics_yolov5/) model loaded from pytorch hub.
Available in the [models](./models) directory are the yolov5n and yolov5s models.
